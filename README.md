ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Varun, a Java backend and fullstack engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable, production-grade applications.

I specialize in:

âœ… Backend APIs with Java 17, Spring Boot 3

âœ… Frontend apps with React.js / Next.js

âœ… CI/CD pipelines and deployment workflows (Docker, GitHub Actions, etc.)

Iâ€™ve worked on everything from internal tools to customer-facing dashboards, handling data integration, REST APIs, and cloud-based architectures. My focus is clean code, fast delivery, and great communication.
